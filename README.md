## [CMPE 277] - Android Application to Clean Cities

iReport is an Android application that can help contribute towards the cause of reducing litter in an effort to be environmentally compliant. This app focuses on monitoring and identification of litter by assisting people to report incidents of littering to the City of San Jose. City officials designated to monitor the littering in the city can then go to sites of littering and make sure proper disposal means are implemented to eliminate the litter. The notion behind this implementation is that a better monitoring practice can be enforced by people themselves who can help populate a list of littering incidents and monitor the status of the litter. All of this can be done while a person is on their daily commute and the app is designed so that it is quick and easy and does not take up too much of the user’s time.

By enabling the general populations’ contributions toward waste identification and following precautionary efforts, this app can enable companies in the future to successfully identify safer means of disposal and take quicker actions at reducing the waste at hand.
